# Shorest-Path-in-a-maze
This project uses the Breadth First Search and Backtracking algorithms to find the shortest path in a maze from the start to end point. Different colors are used to illustrate the paths. The program first find all the paths available via BFS and then returns the shortest path via backtracking. 

Tools used:
